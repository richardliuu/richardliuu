Hi there!

I'm Richard Liu, a student at Milliken Mills High School.

I mainly code in Python and have some of my hackathon projects on my profile. 
I like to share problems that I do on platforms like LeetCode, CodeForces, and DMOJ.

I also look forward to getting into machine learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning.

If you want to get in touch with me, feel free to check out my projects and send me a message.
